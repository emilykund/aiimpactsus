        <h2>Artificial Intelligence Impacts US</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence has been around for decades but it's really advanced in the last year or so. With technology advancing at a fast pace, we need to get an understanding of it and get ahead of it, before we're trying to figure out how to adapt to it before it gets out of hand.</p>
        <p>AI can be very helpful to our everyday lives and for business, but there are also some really big questions about the future. As a result, we are starting a small think tank-esque initiative. If you are interested in learning more about what we're doing and our progress, please sign up to get relevant updates.</p>

        <h2 id="background-title">Background</h2>
        <p>The goal of this initiative is to identify the challenges and risks that AI poses and to the extent possible, develop recommendations for how we anticipate and actively manage the risks, rather than putting ourselves in a very reactive position whereby our Congress doesn't understand the technology and the risks well enough to govern or communicate the concerns, the consequences, commitments, and any corrective actions needed.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this objective, we will initially begin with a "brain dump" of thoughts to get the process started. We will enlist the help of experts in their respective fields (labor, economics, social sciences by way of examples), leveraging existing studies and data where possible.</p>

            <p>We're trying to build a small think tank, a think ofuro if you will (four is Japanese for bathtub). One that informs the American public and helps inform our elected officials. This is a non-partisan initiative where <strong>we put people above politics</strong>. Whether you're blue, green, red, white, purple, or any other tint in between, we all have certain needs, which are outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.</p>

        <p>We are currently putting together a team of people to leverage existing data and studies to inform and influence the public.</p>
        <p>The desired work products (at least initially) are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a white paper for policy makers</li>
          <li>a primer for people to understand AI and how it can impact them (both positively and negatively)</li>
          <li>social media assets to communicate the findings out to the population</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At least initially, we anticipate that there will be at least two phases of this work.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research and synthesize key findings</li>
          <li>Communicate findings out via social media, webinars, meetings, and interviews</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If this sounds like a project you are interested in contributing to, please complete the contribution interest form.</p>
        <p><em><strong>Note: We are in the process of formalizing so that we can secure funding.</strong></em></p>
